AI REFLECTION:

I used copilot considerably more than I usually do.
I did use the autocomplete feature, but encountered several problems integrating javafx.
I used copilot to integrate files and structure the project so it would actually compile, but I do think I need to do more research to be able to consistently make projects that compile without relying on it.
I also used it to troubleshoot when elements refused to appear or broke the program.
A list of my prompts is below.

help me run javafx (i didn't know what was wrong at the time so used an intentionally vague prompt)
Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application (copy and pasted error message)
run DrawApp.java using Maven
Install Maven (prompts my friend used that worked)
Terminal still reports JavaFX runtime components are missing, meaning DrawApp.java is still not runnable. How can I fix this issue? (never fully fixed hence the program only running with a command)
shapeButtons is allowing multiple RadioButtons to be selected at once. How can I fix this?
The slider element is not showing in the program. How can I fix this?
the controls VBox is taking up the full screen. I need it to be smaller and in the top left corner but nothing seems to be working.
An error occurred while compiling, saying it cannot find the javafx symbol "Button". I don't know how to fix this.

I also want to work on organizing my code to make it more readable because the later portions of it were a headache.
